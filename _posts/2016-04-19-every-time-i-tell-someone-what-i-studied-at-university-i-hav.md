Every time I tell someone what I studied at University I have the same conversation. I've had it 4 times in the last week. So I thought I'd get my thoughts down - it'll save me time as I can just point people to the answer, but more than that, it's actually worth thinking about. In these days of vocational degrees, is there any value at all in studying something for its own sake?

By the way this does tangentially relate to recruitment so I feel quite justified in putting it on LinkedIn. If you prefer, you can imagine this has the title "what role does tertiary education play in the selection process?". 

My degree (and indeed my postgraduate degree) is in Classics. That means I studied Latin and Ancient Greek, and the various literary, historical and philosophical texts that are extant in the original languages. In fact I studied those languages for about 12 years each. The usual question at this point is "What? _Why?_"

There are a number of answers:

* Because I wanted to
* Because it's interesting
* Because languages, even dead ones (especially dead ones perhaps) are fascinating and beautiful even if you can't use them every day
* Because back in the day I wasn't pushed towards a vocational degree - I was told to get a good degree in something I was interested in and then cross train (I do appreciate that this doesn't apply if you want to study medicine or something but there was never any danger of that).
* Because the study itself teaches you all sorts of useful skills
* Because being able to read works of literature that have defined much of the trajectory of western civilisation in the original languages is valuable.

I don't regret it for a moment. But I don't want to just make this a post about classics; I do actually want to broaden it and make a plea for the purist degree. Obviously there are exceptions, but a lot of the time a degree that might seem random actually offers a lot that might not be immediately apparent - a rigour of thought, a determination to pursue a difficult discipline to a conclusion, an interest in something _other than just their job_ (whisper it softly) - all of these things might just be useful. Classics, to take my example, combines the need to learn a couple of very structured and rigid dead languages with the ability to read and appreciate philosophy, history and drama in those languages. A soft option it ain't. 

In my line of work I find myself more often than not looking for IT people who have a strong business understanding, and domain expertise. I work mostly on the cusp between technology and business. For those sort of roles an engineering background is obviously useful. But actually so is a business background - no-one's got academic experience in both. Often the right candidate has a much broader range of interests and experience than just the tech (or just the domain for that matter). Other interests and skills are useful. They bring something different to the table. 

I'm not suggesting hard and fast rules. Nor I am trying to diminish the value of a formal academic career in IT or engineering or whatever it is. But allow me a little plea for some grey. It takes all sorts. I did Classics because I liked it. I still like it. I know lots of stuff you probably don't know. You know lots of stuff I probably don't know. We can learn from each other and enjoy doing so. That's all there is to it, really. 

(As an aside I can answer another question I get all the time while I'm here - why Vocative? Well, the Vocative case is the case you use in Latin when you're addressing someone - so it seemed appropriate to a business that is all about talking to people). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d341e15d-0dfd-4f19-acd1-400d5f13e747.jpg)
